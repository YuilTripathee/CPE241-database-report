\chapter*{Abstract}

We started this project to understand and apply database systems into a real world scenario. Hotel management system is one of the popular application projects being used in universities around the world to let students exercise their database design and implementation skills. We started with learning through the domain knowledge. However, things did not go as planned and we had to revise our ER model throughout our journey which we have documented as part of this report. Finally, a web application was developed (using Node.JS + MongoDB stack combination) and improvised so that multiple stakeholders can interact with our application. Each kind of end user has their own permission levels to different resources depending on the stake of their interaction with a hotel environment.

\textbf{Keywords}: database, hotel management, ER model

% EXAMPLE ABSTRACT:
% This project started with the objective of understanding database systems and applying the knowledge to practical usage. After consideration and research, we chose to create a digitized platform for human resources management. Human resources management is necessary for most companies and involves many processes that could be digitalized and automated. Therefore, it would be a good topic for our database design studies.
